# Molybdenum

Basically a improved version of ungoogled-chromium, for the advanced users.

## How to Install

Since there is no easy way to get it, you would have to build from source in your respective OS / distro.  
Since there is **no one-size-fits-all solution**, that part is left up to you to do. I *will* give you a link on how to build from source, but other than that, you are on your own.

## Target audience

Here are the users molybdenum targets:

- Timothy (30) has been using computers since 1992. He is well versed with using CLI and TUI tools, and does not need a gui for most of his work.
- Sam (40) is a fan of computers ever since the early 80's. She can code extremely well, and she does not need help 60% of the time.

These are what molybdenum does **not** target:

- John (14) has just gotten onto Windows 11 after using his tablet for a few years. John needs a GUI based installer to do his "work".
- Grandma (50) remembers "the old days", back when she had to walk uphill both ways. Suffice to say, she does not know about computers. *That's putting it politely.*

This does not mean that John and Grandma can not use molybdenum. It's just that molybdenum might not be the right tool for them, and they might be better off using [librewolf](https://librewolf.net) instead.

## How to Use

Once you got the... *relatively* difficult step of installing Moly, you can just click on the icon that says "Molybdenum" on it, and poof!

## Contributions

Since this *is* based off of ungoogled-chromium (like I said at the *very, very* start), you gotta send *US* a PR, and try to exclude the forkee.

## One more thing.

Goodbye!
